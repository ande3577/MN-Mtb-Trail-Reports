<b>Mar 6 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=103">Highland 9-hole Golf Course</a> (Saint Paul):</b><br>

Conditions: Good! Was groomed either this morning or later yesterday, nice surprise. Track was set with nice depth, almost as good as Woodlands.<br>Thanks St Paul Park & Rec (Jeff) for the grooming. I know the skiers that were out this morning appreciated the effort.<br>

<b>Feb 12 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=588">Green Acres Recreation</a> (Lake Elmo):</b><br>

Conditions: Great!<br>Today was so much nicer than yesterday.  Don't know if it was because yesterday afternoon there were only a few skiers compared to the energy of today with all the Sisu lessons OR because I couldn't get my poles to grab yesterday in the classic track.  I didn't want to quit.  Green Acres is the cure for the 2011-2012 MN Winter Blues!<br>

<b>Feb 12 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=588">Green Acres Recreation</a> (Lake Elmo):</b><br>
Conditions: Great - for the season.<br>It was better than it has been all season. The snow is backed down real nice, but it got a little grainy on the hills. Overall it was great, and worked out really well. Thanks to the groomers who worked hard all year to keep it in good conditions.<br>

<b>Feb 12 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=97">Theodore Wirth Regional Park</a> (Minneapolis):</b><br>
Conditions: Surprisingly good.<br>I skied the course early this afternoon. Despite the very heavy use on this beautiful winter day, the trail was in remarkably good condition. By the time I finished a bit before 3:00, there were a few icy spots and ruts on the downhills, but nothing to complain about--especially this winter!  A huge thank you to the crew at Wirth for keeping this trail going all season long. It is a bright spot in a sea of brown.<br>

<b>Feb 12 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=98">Elm Creek Park Reserve</a> (Maple Grove):</b><br>

Conditions: WOW - The classic track was great!<br>The grooming staff at Elm Creek are the best! The track was perfect, not icy at all this morning. The skate lane was also terrific. How lucky we are! Also, now that HS sectionals are over it was not cheek-by-jowl crowded. Perhaps the fact that it was 6 degrees also helped.<br>

<b>Feb 12 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=98">Elm Creek Park Reserve</a> (Maple Grove):</b><br>

<b>Feb 11 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=588">Green Acres Recreation</a> (Lake Elmo):</b><br>

Conditions: Remarkable.<br>Hats off to the Green Acres crew for their tremendous effort to keep the system in top shape.  The state qualifiers from Stillwater had a great week-end workout.  After the wild swings of melting and freezing, the slush and the ice, it was amazing to be skiing on white packed snow (alongside brown fields).  We're so fortunate to have this facility on the east side in a year like this.  It is less crowded now as the high school season is nearly complete.  Get out and enjoy!<br>

<b>Feb 11 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=97">Theodore Wirth Regional Park</a> (Minneapolis):</b><br>

<li>
<b>Feb 11 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=588">Green Acres Recreation</a> (Lake Elmo):</b><br>

<b>Feb 10 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=97">Theodore Wirth Regional Park</a> (Minneapolis):</b><br>
Frozen hard with many frozen ruts and icy spots.  Not even worth the time. <br>
(Kevin Lyons)

<li>
<b>Feb 10 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=98">Elm Creek Park Reserve</a> (Maple Grove):</b><br>
Conditions: Very good.<br>Solid classic track, a little icy, but not as much I as expected with the drop form 38F to 8F.  Green worked fine in the morning and early afternoon.  Skate track was rolled and hard.<br>

(Tom Ferry)

<li>
<b>Feb 10 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=97">Theodore Wirth Regional Park</a> (Minneapolis):</b><br>
Conditions: A mix of good and terrible--caution required.<br>Deep frozen ruts on the uphills and some curves required caution.  Flats and most downhills were quite fine, but I found it hard to "get in the groove" and ski with confidence with that variability.  I quickly modified my goal for the day from number of laps to simply not falling down.<br>
(Lois Braun)

<b>Feb 10 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=97">Theodore Wirth Regional Park</a> (Minneapolis):</b><br>

<b>Feb 10 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=108">Como Golf Course</a> (Saint Paul):</b><br>

(Stephen Dinger )

<li>
<b>Feb 9 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=98">Elm Creek Park Reserve</a> (Maple Grove):</b><br>

Conditions: Very good for skate.<br>Skate skiing on Thursday evening at Elm Creek was very good.  Firm base, with about 0.5-1 inch of loose snow on top.  Very fast, but no problems with edging.  Minor sugar on the climb up out of the donut, but the descent entrance is in better shape since last time.  Classic tracks looked in very good shape as well. Not crowded at all (starting at 7:30); at most 20 people were out skiing at any one time.<br>
(Ted Lystig)

<li>
<b>Feb 9 - Medicine Lake (Plymouth):</b><br>
Conditions: The tracks have returned! The little remaining snow on the lake has blown into the ice tracks formerly groomed by the West Medicine Lake Ski Club. If you stick to the East side of the peninsula there is more snow in the tracks.<br>Now with the official ban on all cars on Hennepin County lakes,  hopefully we can keep the ski tracks a little longer. Yeah!<br>
(Karla Anderson)

<li>
<b>Feb 9 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=588">Green Acres Recreation</a> (Lake Elmo):</b><br>

Conditions: New clean snow added - greatly improved.<br>Skating was very good Thursday morning on clean, fast snow. Much of the trail had been refreshed and more clean snow was being added from a huge pile at the top of the sledding hill. No problem using good skis. There is a classic track.<br>
(Russ Ludeke)

<li>
<b>Feb 9 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=97">Theodore Wirth Regional Park</a> (Minneapolis):</b><br>
Conditions: Nice conditions (for me).<br>Skated around 8 on Thursday and about 3-4 other people there.  The groomers were out on the Pisten Bully and where they had groomed was really soft.  I tried to ski on the ungroomed stuff and the far outside as much as possible so as not to gouge the grooming.  I also skipped the left-turn drop. I really do wish the groomers would wait until the park is closed to groom.  With a 5 degree low tonight, I'm sure all those gouges will set up and be not so pleasant for those in the morning.<br>

<b>Feb 8 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=97">Theodore Wirth Regional Park</a> (Minneapolis):</b><br>
Conditions: Sheer ice.<br>As Elm Creek had HS races scheduled through 7:30 pm, I went over to Wirth for the first time this season at 4 pm yesterday. After one loop of classic I gave up for two reasons (wrong wax for the ice conditions), and concern about staying in control on the downhills (ice once again). We need new snow ... natural or man made. What a difference a few days makes ... had a good ski at Wirth during the City of the Lakes Loppet.<br>

<b>Feb 8 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=97">Theodore Wirth Regional Park</a> (Minneapolis):</b><br>
Conditions: Decent for skate.<br>I went skate skiing Wednesday evening at Wirth from @6:30-8.  Plenty of coverage, but most of the course has about 1-2 inches of sugar snow over an icy base.  It's still reasonably fast with plenty of control.  The spots where the icy underlayer get exposed are usually on uphills.  Classic track looked like it came and went throughout the loop.  Best conditions were on the (unlit) portion of the loop going through the start/finish area by the lower golf building- firm without the sugar.  The descent by the tubing hill is a bit challenging when the tubing lights are turned off at 8pm.  <br>

<b>Feb 7 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=98">Elm Creek Park Reserve</a> (Maple Grove):</b><br>
Conditions: Very good for classic.<br>The classic tracks at Elm Creek on Tuesday evening were solid and very fast.  Unlike other recent days, there was even enough loose snow around to make striding easier (previously the tracks were icier).  The no-wax skis were singing and zinging.  Looked like the skate lane was quite firm, but not as icy as it has been lately.  A bit of sugar on the sweeping downhill into the donut, but overall in good shape.<br>

Conditions: Good and fast for classic.<br>Classic skiing on Friday evening at Elm Creek was fast.  Tracks were deep and solid, and only washed out near the pedestrian bridge and by the teaching meadow.  Double poling was a treat, and grip with the no-wax was sufficient for the uphills.  The downhill on the donut was a bit tricky, but the inside line seemed best.<br>

Conditions: Man-made snow, but the worst I have seen it on a weekday ever.  Looks like it hadn't been groomed the night before.<br>Classic tracks were just ice, I double poled the whole classic workout. Skate track was hard in areas, soft in others.  The big hill was the best I had seen it all year.  There were more "potholes" and "speedbumps" than I've ever seen on the man-made snow loop, beware, especially the last loop.  <br>

Cloud cover helps - none of that ice and slush mix today.   Enough sugar on top for good edge, balance and some sub-threshold V2 skating.  Rock skis not needed, just need to keep watch for a few thin spots and stay agile.  Thanks again to Green Acres (and Ben Popp) for salvaging the season.<br>

Conditions: Poor.<br>I was able to ski 1 km before I had to remove my skis to traverse a brown section of the trail.

Surprisingly good.  Skied the whole 5K - and could have used my better skis.  There are some woodchips and the occasional rock showing, but very avoidable.  Only once between 2 and 3K is there a rock on the back side of a bump that you might not notice.  Track is a bit icy for classic, and you occasionally need to lift one ski when it disappears.  Better for skaters with sharp edges.  Just happy to be able to ski more than 3K without repeating... (no offense, Theodore).  Thanks, George and the crew!  Don't be fooled by the inviting look of the 10K offshoots as you start - we headed off down one of them and soon found ourselves careening down an icy hill toward a spot with a snow-gap all the way across the trail.  My shoulder and hip wish we'd stuck to the 5K.<br>

Conditions: Fair.<br>Skated the 5k and part of the 10. The 5 is in better shape since they have not recently regroomed the 10 since real winter temps showed up, so a bit icy and easy to lose an edge. The 5 was groomed earlier but a bit skied in by the time I arrived but in decent shape in most places, considering. Bumpy in places (most noted by the biathlon range).  Thanks again Snowflake crew for giving us the only consistent local place to ski this "winter". The Duluth XC community appreciates you!<br>

Conditions: Lots of snow, no grooming.<br>We arrived at Boulder around 2 pm expecting glare ice and were pleasantly surprised when it was great non-icy snow!  We classic skied Blue Ox to Nine Pine and went backwards on  Nine Pine to Lonesome Grouse.  The tracks are skied in the best at Lonesome Grouse and they are faster there but not icy.  The skate lane actually looked pretty good considering there has been no grooming.  Aside from a few easy to get around patches it's fully covered.  If they could get out and just do a touch up it might be perfect skating!<br>

Conditions: Fairly good.<br>Expected goodly fair but was exuberant to find 8.01 with the rock ski handicap.  The typical rocks were showing through but less than expected. The 5k was in great shape with a hard deck this morning.  I'm glad I turned a stiff pair of skis into rocky's as I would've been turning triple lutz's on the trail with my default pair.

Considering this winter, the trails were in good condition.  It is possible to ski almost all of the 5K and 10K.  It was my first time there so I got a bit lost but ended up skiing by the owner, George, who was a wonderful guide, so friendly and knowledgeable.

Trouble areas as usual on south hills but the Snowflake crew has snow-patched a couple of the areas on the 5K. 10k has one area you have to dismount just before Hovland's Hill (likely more than that by tomorrow PM). There is a solid, albeit thin, base that is holding up well to this crazy weather. Lots 'o folks out enjoying it today.<br>

We skated Bear Paw and Blue Ox at dusk, before the candlelight ski event. The trails still have good coverage, mostly. They were icy in spots, rutted in spots, and very nice in some spots. A couple of people had hiked on them, right down the middle of the skate lane. There was an intermittent skied-in track. <br>
We skated out onto Boulder Lake for awhile, too. It's a bit of a tough ski, a crust on top of soft stuff, some patches of ice blown clear by the wind. Hard to get an edge. Still fun, and very, very pretty.  Definitely better than not skiing.<br>

There was plenty of snow on what I skied and they have done an outstanding job of grooming!  It would be very well worth the trip to ski there!<br>

Conditions: Fair to just holding on. Cloudy, 30 degrees.<br>Sun has taken it's toll on more spots along the trail. Skied the Highland trail, which had pretty good coverage throughout. However, the Highland has never been tracked this year and the user tracks are getting sloppy. Southern Lights has been tracked so the tracks were tighter but it has more bare spots. For sure "B" skis, and if we lose much more it will be back to rock skis.<br>

Only thinned areas were a couple low spots and steep south hills on Silver. Freshly groomed this morning with a combination of snow and transformed snow. Looks like actual winter up there.

Conditions: We still have snow!<br>The Ridge dodged another melt down last week, surviving several days in the high thirties.  I used my good skis Friday, Saturday and Sunday with no threat of rocks, roots, or debris.  The skate lane on Gold, Silver, Bronze, Summit, and Cedar are still 100% snow covered and near perfect conditions.  The outer loops (Laurentian, Wynne Creek, Biwabik Spur, and Oslo) still look good also.  If you are semi conscious of your surroundings while skiing you can use your good skis on all 60K.<br>

Conditions: Dicey.<br>Pretty good coverage, but a little tricky in the early morning before it softened up.  The tracks are blown out on most of the uphills and downhills. Very pretty area, made me wish I just had my BC gear to ski in untracked areas.  The lakes are all untouched.  Until it gets groomed again, be careful when it is still frozen solid.<br>

<b>Feb 5 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=349">Big Aspen Recreation Area</a> (Virginia):</b><br>
Conditions: Absolutely wonderful! Most of the system has great track. Solid pole plants. From#4 to # 6 outer loop it is user tracked due to not a lot of snow there. But everywhere else is cookie cutter tracks. There is even track set from the top shelter down to #13. If you are brave enough to try it.<br>We did most of the east loop , down to 7 and from there is the best tracks in the more shaded areas. From 9 to 8 and back to the lot. Mr. Moose enjoyed the grooming too. But he had too much fiber and left many big brown piles. Some on downhill corners so beware. <br>

Conditions: Fantastic. Groomed well with good coverage.<br>What a great afternoon out, no make that a SUPER afternoon of skiing at this suburb classic ski trail. Recently we have been telling friends they have to try Big Aspen. Well now is the time! Very good snow coverage for the low snow year we are having. Did see two exposed rocks on the trail and one bare spot but that was it. Made the mistake of taking out the "B" skis, should have used the A's. Gave up some speed because of it. Deer, wolf and Moose tracks to be found out on the trail. We laughed at old Mr. Moose who tracks walked right up to the Junction 8 sign. "Jct. 8, I was looking for 10"! Ended up skiing more than twice what we were going to, because the trail and afternoon was so great. Trail holding up very well in the warmer weather.<br>

Conditions: Summit Bronze trails deep set tracks and great skate lane. Fresh grooming didn't set up in the tracks and you would sink in spots. Pole plants on the outside edge were plunging down to the ground. Biwabik Spur was very good but slow as the frost from the trees was blowing down and filling the tracks. But so beautifully!  Wynne Creek has lots of little brush poking up and is wavy. Just enough snow there to track. <br>
Laurentian had good track and better skating than Wynne Creek. Did last part of the Silver Trail which was very good!<br>Amazing just how much snow is still up there. Very few rocks sticking out but easily avoidable on the outer trails. They are in better shape than I am!<br>

Conditions: Nearly perfect soft clean deep snow!<br>I would say this about anyone not doing Nordic skiing at Giant's Ridge today, "I pity the fool!"  Conditions are nearly perfect!  Despite that, we only saw four other people while classic skiing the entire 13.4 KM of the Gold trail!  Everyone else we saw was skating and even though they were pretty skilled, we passed them twice on our classic skis.  The classic trails are that good!  We reached 38 Km/hr on one of the descents!  We were using our race skis, including a pair of Atomic World Cup skis on snow for the first time.  I saw one tiny tip of a rock in the entire outing and that was in the skate track, not the classic track.  It's warm, it's sunny, the conditions are great, and you have the place to yourself.<br>

Trees are too thick in there to allow for coverage.<br>There was the annual Luminary ski for winter frolic taking place. Queen candidates, many who have never skied before, go out in the dark with small lights along the trail and try to stay upright. Some turn back to save themselves bodily harm. But one determined young lady made it around the loop! Congratulations Miranda for sticking it out. We are proud of you.<br>

Conditions: West side skating still good but in need of a touch up after the warm weekend temps. 6-8" base, no classic track in yet.  Expect careful grooming this weeknd to bring back a smooth skate lane and classic skiing.  Temps in the teens, mixed clouds and sun.<br>It was a warm weekend in northern Minnesota and burned some serious holes in the south facing open areas of the course. At this time there isn't a way to get skiers out to the east side trails. However, our west side trails are tucked away nicely in the shade and were able to make it through just fine, so our race plan B is a short course using 10+ kilometers all on the west side.  I plan to touch these up just once to tiller up the dry snow that is still there, set a classic track and figure out how to spruce up the tunnel and start areas with snow we can move.  Should some snow fly we could be back up in short order grooming the full 25k east and west as these have been packed and skied this season.  Right now the forecast is generally clear meaning single digit nights and sunny 20F days.  That's good news folks!  Wax em up, pack the car and see you out at the start line!

Conditions: Only one little icy spot on all of Skater's Waltz at mid section of Kamakazee Hill. With the name of the hill posted on a sign at the top, it already requires a little looking further ahead than the norm. No problem going over the glazed spot with lower center of gravity, wide balance points and larger than normal eye diameter! Skate deck on North Loup and Skater's Waltz, firm fast with easy edge control. Fantastic texture around noon today; temps from mid-teens into low 20's.<br>I almost felt guilty being the first one to carve into the freshly rolled snow after it had time to set up perfectly. In order to make the guilt worthwhile 4 laps were required. In the middle of the 4th lap halfway up the hill that ends always a little too late, the guilt was gone. Always a treat to ski in the woods at Maplelag.<br>

Conditions: 28*F above; clear skies; light SW breeze; frozen granular base; base depth varies from 1 to 4 inches; existing track frozen ice glazed; Black Bear Tr., Wolf Run; Buck’s Run, Cougars Run, Hawks Trail, and Deer View Trail groomed with scratcher bars and track sets refreshed with track setters; 7.5K course for upcoming XC Skiing Day has been groomed with scratcher bars; entire trail system skiable with a variety of short patches of exposed leaves/grass,etc.; ski conditions rated as very good to good.<br>We started out early this morning with below 0 temps hauling a little snow to some light areas on the course for the upcoming Short Notice: Saving XC Skiing Day. With the temps rising quickly to 20*F I continued by grooming our trails system with the scratcher bars and resetting tracks. Through out the trail system I found several short distances areas of exposed trail base however skiing around those areas should not be a problem. Track sets are crumbly and are not to full depth in some areas; however by re tracking the ice broke and mixed fairly well. The couple of mild days from this past week really changed the look of the woods and trails. We will continue prepping the course for Sunday’s event during the week and post further reports of conditions.<br>

<b>Feb 6 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=7">Maplelag Resort</a> (Callaway):</b><br>
Conditions: Mid-winter 'almost'perfect! Enough snow to not have any concerns about having grass and duff unexpectantly stopping a ski and doing cartwheels with skinnys attached. Very few spots that merit attention due to ice, making fast paced cadence an advanced skill. Tracks set deep enough to let them ride ride, allowing thoughts other then those connected with feet to enter the mind ; like wow it's really winter and it's so white!<br>Skied many classic trails, too many to recall. All skied were in terrific condition. Kept skates in the bag, keeping off from the just groomed skate deck being prepped for lucky Section 8 Nordic athletes. Temp when starting out was 27, don't think it got much higher. No sign of melt on any trail skied. HS skiers tomorrow should be skiing on as close to perfect conditions as possible. Skaters in bag in back of my truck were making pleads to get out and go. I told them Wednesday!<br>

<b>Feb 5 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=7">Maplelag Resort</a> (Callaway):</b><br>
Conditions: Good to excellent. Close to an inch of fallen frost on top of hardpack base. Few areas of thin cover/ice sections.<br>Today was a magical day for a variety of reasons. The frost setting was absolutely stunning before falling late afternoon. Frost hanging on most of the day was a good sign as the temps stayed cool and about 10 degrees lower than forecast. Late afternoon the kamikaze hill section was groomed, working in the frost with the transformed snow on kamikaze hill. A short ski later to check out the courses for the Section race on Tuesday found the trails in great shape. Personally, the skiing, in particular skating, doesn't get any better even if it is a "non winter" or "no snow year" (hence my rating of excellent). The tracks set before the weekend are holding out great and the frost refreshed things nicely. <br>

Grooming plans: We will be grooming the Section course Monday afternoon with the Ginzus, setting complete new texture on the skate course and conditioning the classic course before setting new tracks. The courses will be closed during that time but all other trails open and very good skiing with a few thin areas etc. here and there.<br>

Temp cooling down a bit lower last night , with lowest readings in the mid teens. Not as warm forecast today so the snow should be dry and silky all day. Trails getting refreshed from frost falling from the trees. Skaters Waltz groomed last night. Trails groomed Thursday and Friday in good shape and holding out great.

<b>Feb 6 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=600">Cannon Valley Trail</a> (Cannon Falls):</b><br>
Conditions: Very good.  Groomed for skating after the last snow about a week and a half ago; near 100% coverage on 2/12 mile stretch from Sunset Rd or Avenue west.  High 30's and sunny. I used yellow LF.<br>My mountain bike foray east from Cannon Falls earlier this weekend prematurely ended when I discovered there was still skiable snow on the trail.  So I returned to get in some all too rare skiing on real snow this winter after limited activity during a three week illness.  It didn't disappoint. <br>
The bluffs on the trail's southside shade the trail perfectly from the sun.  I was able to do 2/12 miles of skiing in one direction interrupted only once by a bare bridge deck.  The snow depth was just enough.  The asphalt showed through in a number of spots where animal or human foot prints penetrated. A bike tire track was along the edge for portion of trail as well.  (Oh yeah that was me.)  But with minimal caution full tilt skating - at least at my 59-year-old pace - was possible.  I had to double back for a mile when I forgot my buttpack at the Anderson Rest stop so I got in about 6 1/2 miles of skiing in beautiful conditions and scenery.  I had a great sunset as I headed west and my return to the east headed into a wonderful full moonrise.<br>

The far south end of the Birkie trail faired very well. The photoset shows the end of Lake Hayward ready for tilling, and the southern road crossings in great shape. Pre-Birkie skiers should expect some dirty hauled-in snow from the end of the lake to Duffy Rd. (approx 60 yards).

The classical tracks are good to excellent, but pure klister is the wax dejour.  The Pre Birkie should be fast and fun.<br>

Conditions: Quite good.<br>Skate skiing at Seeley Ski Trails on Saturday evening was quite good.  We started at 4:30, and used headlamps to continue until 6:30.  The skate deck was very firm, but not icy.  No slush spots either.  A couple spots where the coverage was getting thin in the skate lane, but still definitely race ski conditions.  Classic tracks on the longer (7.5K) loop were thin on a few south facing hills, but problem spots looked to be easily avoidable.  Nicely groomed.<br>

Conditions: Good, hard and fast. 100 percent coverage.<br>Started late afternoon and dying sun let the excellent grooming firm up. The skate deck seemed fast and the tracks were very solid. The trails need more traffic to open up the tracks. Someone with skinny skis pressed a deep groove which caused our boots to drag and skis to occasionally clamp between the walls. But it was the best classic skiing you will find in these warm temps. Should be good on Sunday early or late. Thank you groomers!<br>

Conditions are excellent!  The trail is flat, fast, and firm.  The skate deck was cut up Friday night from Mosquito Brook to Timber Trail on both the Classic and Skate Trails.  51k of fresh skate deck.  The tracks are firm and transformed, still solid from the last grooming.  They are not ice, they are transformed.  You must use klister.  The skiing is perfect and so is the weather.  The South skate trail has a couple of hills that will open up this weekend and they will be repaired once the temps stay below freezing as of Tuesday.  These hills are at 30.9k and 30.05k on the skate trail.  Use caution at these points.  Enjoy the Birkie trail and the nice weather this weekend!<br>

Conditions: As good as real snow gets, this year.<br>The groomers are doing an awesome job, given this winter's miserly snow conditions. They have been kind enough to put snow over the thin spots, of which there are very few, all things considered. Skiing was fast in the shade, slow in the sun--made for weird waxing conditions. But, thin spots and schmutz was easily avoidable, in both skate & classic. Kudos, Brule!<br>

Candlelight ski Saturday night was fun as it always is. My understanding is that they trucked in snow to cover a few bare patches (so the candlelight could go on) and then it snowed four inches. It was a dark night, stayed in the classic tracks, which in most spots are quite nice. One time I hopped out into the skate lane and promptly crashed -- skate lane isn't super flat. But I think the groomers did a nice job with what they had.<br>

Conditions: Varied and icy.<br>We arrived around 10:45 to ski today hoping that the NOAA site was correct and it would hit 35F at that time, but it turned out to be only 26 and reached 33 when we left around 1:45.  The younger groomer was out when we got there going pretty fast on the snowmobile and unfortunately only scratched up half of a few of the trails which was disappointing because it was pretty icy.  White Pine was the worst of all and untouched.  It has some open spots which are easy to get around.  The entire system has plenty of snow and just a few spots here and there that could easily be covered up with some snow off of the side of the trail.  We still had a great ski!<br>

Overall the system is in good shape. Suggest skiing after 11:00 am tomorrow unless you are very comfortable with icy conditions. In Maple, my car thermometer read 29F this morning, but five miles later at Brule it was 16F. This made for real fast, but icy conditions early in the morning.

The entire trail system still has good cover, the trails where we are concentrating our grooming are mostly smooth, and the untouched 3/4" of fresh snow provides nice edge control on the sun exposed downhills.  The classic tracks (set 10-14 days ago) have fresh snow awaiting skiers.  <br>
Grooming plans: Next grooming is anticipated late morning Sunday when temps warm enough to allow some softening of the underlying hardpack.<br>

The Eastside skate lane was groomed (scarified) this morning, yielding just enough edge control to allow ski-with-abandon skating.

Conditions: Very good.<br>Our groomers (with help from our shoveling brigades) have been putting in unbelievable hours this past week and it shows, as we remain 100% open heading into the weekend. We are continuing to patch bare spots as they pop up (usually on southern facing steep exposed hills), but as of today there are no long bare stretches anywhere. Skate decks are running hard and fast but have a softer top than you would expect for dealing with transformed ice and snow. Skating is considered very good to excellent around the park. Classic is more variable. We have firm, deep tracks everywhere but some are still glazed and icy owing to the near daily thaw/refreeze conditions for a week straight -- it's not simply a matter of which classic tracks have been reset and which haven't, it's a matter of when. <br>
Grooming plans: By Saturday we hope to have reset most, if not all, of the classic tracks in the park. <br>

Excellent. Trails groomed up great tonight. Held up very well at 39F. A 72 year old grandmother, did the polar plunge, went down the tubing hill at least 10 times, skied and snowshoed today. I hope I am in that shape at 62. Due to the way we groom, and 120" snowfall average, a deep base remains on our trails. Trails have been groomed 35 of the last 42 nights.<br>

Conditions: Variable, but it was skiing.<br>Phil was coaxed into grooming on Tuesday so the xc team had somewhere to train. He has groomed the green trail, mixed conditions, 80% is good, a few icy spots, some dirt mixed with snow, and three bare spots.  I am a skier to the core so it was worth the drive Wednesday night plus the moon coming up was spectacular.  I got to celebrate one of my best friends 50th bday with a ski then some beer and pizza. Ski on - the Birkie is looming on the horizon.<br>
Grooming plans: Phil was going to make snow Wednesday night but had some issues so he plans to try again tonight.  The first bare spot is in front of the chalet so you need to walk up to the trail head to start.  That is where he hopes to make snow, there is a barn spot by the silo but if you go straight at cut off it can be avoided, the last bare spot is on the flats after the hill going into the s curves.  With snow making Phil is hoping to fill those areas in and have a completed loop for this weekend. <br>

Badger State Scouting Report:  Just finished skiing the 21/43 km course. 100 percent snow covered - no ice, or dirt. Was in the upper 30's but held up well. Skate lane was fine. Track was not, but they are suppose to be setting new track tonight. Evidence of lots of shoveling by volunteers. Be sure to thank them. <br>
Expect firm conditions in the morning, softening through the day. Downhills will be fast, and turns at the bottoms will be scraped to ice by the second lap. <br>
Note - course change for 43 km. Leo's Loop is out. Instead, there will be three laps around the final 7 km - my favorite part of the course. Have fun tomorrow!<br>

East and north sides were mostly icy; south and especially west were either slushy or just worn down to the brown ground.  A decent day for skate skiing on my old waxless skis.  Frankly, this area is so pretty, any excuse to be out there in winter is worthwhile.  $8 day use fee, as it's a county park.<br>

Pretty good for skating.  I did the green trail, then cut over to the purple and then a brown.  The snow coverage was pretty good with some icy areas and a few spots with dirt showing.  There was also a bit of debris on the trail. Not the best but at least it is skiable.<br>

Conditions: 1-1.5" hard packed trail over ice.  Rock skis only!<br>Skied from 3-6pm today and conditions were much better than I expected. Jeff did a great job grooming and the snow adhered to the ice very nice. The back green (after the green-purple cutoff) is in poor shape until the big hill. You can also ski to the overlook, but like Jeff said, I wouldn't venture down to the south marsh (just ski back and take the green downhill cutoff which is in very good shape). Overall grade A, grooming A+.<br>

Most of the trails were good, but several trouble spots included sections on the first .5 mile loop (in the pines) and a few sections on the red.  SW yellow pass the west red was the best.

<b>Feb 12 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=379">Zillmer Ski Trails</a> (Campbellsport):</b><br>
Conditions: Skiable - worth the trip.<br>As of Sunday afternoon the trails were quite skiable.  Rock skis recommended, or "B" skis if you are very careful.  Much of the trail system (90%) is fine - thin, but the new snow adhered to the ice quite well.  In the remaining areas the sun has melted the snow to grass, or in a few places wood chips or rocks.  Watch out on the Yellow Loop coming down the big hill after the Ice Age Center.  Otherwise fairly fast and infinitely more fun than the Gerbil Wheel  :)  Overall, much better than expected and an inch or two of new snow will help a lot.<br>

<b>Feb 11 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=362">Greenbush Ski Trails</a> (Greenbush):</b><br>
Conditions: Good.<br>The Bush is back! Skied every trail except pink today, and the conditions were good. Most of the trail has sufficient though thin coverage. The 3+ inches of new, dry snow hadn't totally adhered or set up yet, so the surface was uneven and slow. Hill from lower to upper parking has numerous icy spots, so only advanced skiers should go down it. There are a few icy patches at other times, but easily avoided. Very thin where purple comes out of pines and is exposed at far end, as well as just before the downhill to the marsh on purple. Use "b" skis if you have them. Snow plowing on hills will destroy cover and expose ice, so try to avoid hills where you're forced to do that.<br>

Conditions: Fair.<br>Most of the trails were in fair condition.  There are several places where gravel is sticking through, most notably on the main outgoing trail from the parking lot.  Some sections were in good shape, especially the campground.  The trail down to the campground has some big bare spots.  It's skiable, but a little risky.  Overall, it was fair and worth the trip.  The blue mound glacier had adhered nicely to the one inch of new snow.  It is worth the trip, but don't use your best skis.<br>

Conditions: Fair.<br>Snowing on the way out and through the first loop. Second loop full sun then snow again upon departure. At least an inch fell on the trails, enough for a novice like me to get an edge on Minx, Willow and Flint.

Conditions: Man-made snow loop  --  mutated "snow" on an ice base.  Generally in good condition for skating.  Track needs work.<br>The man-made snow loop was mostly good Monday night for the Peak Nordic Kids program and other skiers.  The only trouble spot is about 100 meters up the start hill, where there's not enough loose "snow" on top of the icy base.  Other portions of the loop have a layer of loose snow that makes for fun, fast skating.  There is a track around most of the loop. <br>

<b>Feb 12 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=353">Valley Spur</a> (Munising):</b><br>
Conditions: Excellent with 6-8" of fresh snow groomed in before and during the weekend.<br>What a discovery this place was! Drove 6 hours from Highland Park, IL (same as to Minocqua Winter Park) and discovered perhaps the prettiest and most challenging trails I've ever skied on. All trails were freshly groomed for both skating and classic. Well-designed winding hilly trails located in the snow belt were just what the doctor ordered in this snow-starved winter. The warming lodge was super friendly and more than helpful. For a modest trail fee they shared soups, fresh breads and snacks. We'll be back again soon!<br>

Conditions: Continued late-season conditions, "fast and furious'.  Most of the skate lanes were groomed this morning, raked and combed.  Hard, fast deck with plenty of control on the big hills as the temps moved closer to freezing mark.<br>Can not say enough about the grooming at Valley Spur.  Thanks John, John, and Dave.<br>

Conditions: I drove up to ski this past Saturday (skate) and Sunday (classical). I skied trails A, B, C, D, H, W,Y and Z in 35-40 degree temps.  I found conditions on both days to be excellent. Trails are groomed daily, so they were firm and fast with a fresh corduroy skate path to get a nice edge. There is plenty of snow base here to last awhile.<br>The experience was well worth the drive!<br>

<b>Feb 12 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=457">Listening Inn</a> (Crystal Falls):</b><br>

Conditions: Excellent, about an inch of new snow is packed, rolled and all tracks are set.  There is also about 5K of Skate lane.  <br>Cross country ski enthusiasts with wood skis dug them out of their basements and garages to participate in the First Annual Wood Ski Jamboree at the Listening Inn north of Crystal Falls.  This event was held on Saturday and Sunday.  Wood cross country skis have not been popular since the 1970’s and before, when they were the only type of skis available.  The participants found that in colder temperatures (15 F or below) their wood skis were almost as fast as their modern skis, on a well groomed trail.  This event gives skiers who often started their sport on wood skis a good excuse to get out and use them again, and dress the part of old time skiing.<br>

<b>Feb 11 - Fumee Lake Natural Area (Quinnesec):</b><br>
Conditions: A good classic ski trail made by previous skiers.  The trails have not been mechanically groomed.  Fair snow coverage, with very few exposed (and avoidable) spots in the areas you'd expect such as under some pines and in some sunny open areas.<br>We skied around Little and Big Fumee Lakes.  The artesian water at the far end of Big Fumee Lake is delicious treat!  The upper trails did not have a recent ski track. This is a very pretty place, and it provides a neat opportunity to learn some local mining history.<br>

Did not skate, but classic skied the entire system a couple of time and found a nice formed firm track all around.  Kicking good on VR50.  In more then a couple of spot felt like we were skiing on silk, very nice.  One really has to hand it to these trail owners who do such a great job of grooming in this not so great winter of 2012.<br>

<b>Feb 5 - <a href="traildetail.asp?Id=13">Edgewood Golf Course Ski Trail</a> (Fargo):</b><br>
Conditions: Poor at best and really not skiable.<br>Because of the warm temps on Sunday it was possible to skate ski and classic ski where the snow was previously packed down other wise the crust layer would not support a skier.  Lots of dirt, sticks, cart paths, wheel ruts, foot prints, and snow shoe imprints to contend with.<br>
I would not recommend skiing at Edgewood unless we get more snow.  If the snow had been roller packed to make a base this past weekend would of probably been pretty good for skate skiing.<br>
